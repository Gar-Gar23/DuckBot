//               syntaax basics     Syntax is the set of rules, and how JS programs are written

var x, y, z /* first we must declare what variables er are working with
            variables can be strings, numbers, or anything that is definde as an object
*/ 
x =7; y = 8;  // here we are assigning the varible a value 
z = x + y      // here we are computing those values

/* we must make sure that each variable is clearly assigned and computed otherwise sytax errors
the variables can be assigned either sharing the line using the ';' or we can seperate with 
individual lines
x = 7
y = 8
z = x + y

        JS syntax with two types  
    fixed values which are called literals
    literals are numbers with or without decimals and 'strings' 'single' or "double "
    quotes are accepted in JS

    and variable values called.... variables    *creative*
    variable are used to store DATA VALUES  
    the var keyword is used to DECLARE variables
     the '=' is used as an assignment operator  * it is NOT "equal to" like in normal math*
*/

var r; // here wer have defined a variable as x
 r = 2 // here we have assigned the value of 2 to r

 /* operators ( + - * / ) are used to compute values
            addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
    = is used to assign values to variables

    an expression is the combo of variables, values, and operators
    which make a computation. which is then called an expression

            Expressions can contain variable values  x / 2 
            values can strings or numbers  such as 'shield' + ' ' + 'wall'


    JS identifiers 

    Identifiers are used to name variables, keywords, functions and labels
    identifiers must start with a letter, _underscore, or a $
    anything after can be any characters

        JS is case sensitive 
*/
var lastname, lastName;// are different variables
lastname = beavers
lastName = Dambra

/*    JS most compound words are written in camelCase 
hyphens are reserved for the subtration operator

althogh under_scores 
and PascalCase are also used  JS programmers tend to opt for camelCase
